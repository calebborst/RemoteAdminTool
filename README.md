# BaphRAT


# About:
This client-server tool is designed for remote administration, allowing a server to connect and control its connected clients. 
This tool mainly runs and was developed on windows 10, so dont expect it to work smoothly on anything else if at all.


# What is needed to be worked on:
  - [ ] Add encryption support
  - [ ] Make config file customisable
  - [ ] Add support to edit config file from script
  - [ ] Ask before auto generating config file
  - [x] Quick command support
